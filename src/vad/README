This node, listens on the main audio publisher (recorder) and examines frames of audio 
checking if it contains voice activity. 
The VAD is very inefficient as it uses LTSD to mark certain segment as voice and because of 
this, any sound that can stand out from sound in previous frames could trigger the VAD to think 
it got voice activity. 

it listens to 'opencog/audio_raw_data' 
when it thinks it detected voice activity, it publishes on 'opencog/voice_activity'
